## Data Visualization For Library

The desktop application provides the means to convey the data of the library to the members of the library(Students as well as teaching staff). It gives access to 2 slideshow options (Student & Committee), which can be selected as per the librarians requirement. Both slideshows show data visualizations rather than hard data which is cumbersome to understand.Project Made as a part of Object Oriented Programming Course.

2. Database used was MySQL

3. Charts were made using XCharts
